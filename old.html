      <p>An effort to educate the Ethereum community about the gas limit and how it can be used to help improve Ethereum
        scaling.</p>

      <h3>What is the gas block limit?</h3>

      <p>Understanding 'gas' is fundamental to understanding how the Ethereum network functions.</p>

      <p>The EVM - the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) running on each Ethereum node - is an emulation of a computer
        system. One example of a regular, non-blockchain virtual machine is the VirtualBox software, which allows you to
        emulate computer systems (guests) on your physical hardware (hosts). Any operation in the EVM consumes CPU
        cycles, disk access, memory, of the hosting machine (which carries a cost). This cost is paid via Ethereum
        'gas'.</p>

      <p>In order to prevent "overload" of the host, each operation on the EVM consumes a certain amount of gas.
        Accessing memory or writing to disk have differing costs with each EVM operator setting an upper limit to the
        gas consumed during execution of a contract. So, if a malicious operator crafted a smart contract that went into
        an infinite loop, each loop would consume some gas and eventually run into the limit, at which point the EVM
        would abort the execution of this contract. Essentially, the larger, more complex the contract and the more
        operations it performs, the more expensive it is to run it.</p>

      <p>This process creates a fee market using gas prices where users decide how much they are willing to pay for each
        unit of gas. Due to the gas block limit, the fee market almost always determines what order transactions are
        mined in because miners looking to profit will select the transactions with the highest fees.</p>

      <p>There are many key components to a transaction that are important to understand:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Term</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>Gas</td>
          <td>Unit for how much computation work is done.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Gas Price</td>
          <td>How much you’re willing to pay per gas for work (in gwei)</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Tx Cost</td>
          <td>Gas used * Gas Price</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Gas Limit</td>
          <td>Max gas you’ll pay for a certain tx</td>
        </tr>

          <td>Gas Block Limit</td>
          <td>Max gas allowed in a block</td>
        </tr>

      <h3>What is the curent gas block limit?</h3>
      <p><kbd>30,000,000 gas</kbd></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>What are we targetting for the new gas block limit?</h3>
      <p><kbd>40,000,000 gas</kbd></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Why this target specifically?</h3>
      <p>After discussion with multiple community stakeholders, this feels like a reasonable amount to raise the limit
        without putting the network at risk.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How does this help Ethereum?</h3>
      <p>Raising the gas block limit 33% gives Layer 1 Ethereum the ability to process 33% more transactions in a day.
        This has the potential to lower gas fees on L1.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>What about blobs?</h3>
      <p>Blobs (EIP-4844) help Layer 2 transaction fees, not Layer 1 transaction fees. While this is great, we think a
        combination of blobs + increased gas limit + future EIPs such as 7623 and 4444 can be a nice combination for
        across the board scalability improvements.</p>

      <h3>I'm in, how can I help?</h3>
      <p>If you're a validator, you can set flags on your execution clients and consensus clients to signal that you'd
        like to raise the gas limit. Please see below for these flags.</p>

      <p>If you are not a validator, you can help by signalling your social support and spreading our effort on twitter.
